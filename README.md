# Head First Design Patterns (2nd Edition) in TypeScript

This repository contains TypeScript implementations of the design patterns from the book Head First Design Patterns (2nd Edition). The goal is to provide clear and practical examples of each pattern in TypeScript, making it easier to understand and apply these concepts in modern JavaScript development.

## Introduction
